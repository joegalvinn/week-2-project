# week-2-project
Week 2 tech Ed course project

This one was quite hard I felt quite overwhelmed to start. I feel like i understand what needs doing and what needs to go where in a general sense but trying to remember all the diffrent parts specifically and when to use them is very hard.
Im happy with where i got to with my code though I used the inspect tool a lot and had lots of help from websites such as geeksforgeeks, freecodecamp, dev.to, she codes and W3schools.
I didn't get time to add some of the stretch goals I wante to try specifically the sizings on different devices.
